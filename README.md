# CBSilva Dev


### Hi there 👋

My name is Cleberson Silva from Brazil (BR). I've been working as a developer since 2000.

I am a specialist in 4gl progress developer for TOTVS Datasul, and like any tech lover.

I love to study and always be in front of new challenges, right now I'm training / studying front and backend languages (reactjs, angular)

In my free time I like to watch (🎞️), series (📺), drink beer (🍺) with my friends and parents.

Would you like to find me?
